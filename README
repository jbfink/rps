A couple of years ago I was trying to teach myself ruby.  This Rock, Paper, Scissors program was as far as I got.  

I still love it though.  I mean, I *made* it.  Myself.  Me!  And it works!  And now, I give it to you!

Some additional ideas: 

* Use CouchDB to track number of times played, wins, losses and ties
  * so far I have been defining the couchdb layout in the web interface, but remind me to do something in the actual script to test/create.
