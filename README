A couple of years ago I was trying to teach myself ruby.  This Rock, Paper, Scissors program was as far as I got.  

I still love it though.  I mean, I *made* it.  Myself.  Me!  And it works!  And now, I give it to you!

06/2010 -- wow, I've done a fair amount of hacking on this, at least for me.  Separated out the game logic to put into another file and module, changed rps.rb to reflect that, and then added a new script for the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard variant. Phew!

07/2010 -- this is the old version of rps (or, specifically, of the adrbox.rb logic) that I'm keeping around as a reminder of how I got started.
