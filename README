A couple of years ago I was trying to teach myself ruby.  This Rock, Paper, Scissors program was as far as I got.  

I still love it though.  I mean, I *made* it.  Myself.  Me!  And it works!  And now, I give it to you!

* This is the couch2 branch, which I am thinking of doing with couchtiny or some other "real" couch->ruby integration thingo.
